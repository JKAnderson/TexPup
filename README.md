# TexPup

A texture modding platform for Dark Souls 3 and Sekiro. TexPup operates in two modes:  
Pack mode for mod players, which allows you to install texture mods for use with either Mod Engine or UXM,  
and Unpack mode for mod creators, which is capable of extracting all of the game's textures for editing.  

Please read the instructions in the included readme carefully before use.  
If submitting a bug report, make sure to screenshot the error message and/or copy the contents of the error log.  

TexPup can also be found at [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/507).
